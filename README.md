A Command-Line Remote control for Sony Bravia Android TV written in PHP.

It was one of those evenings where I could not find the fu****g remote for my TV. So instead of doing the work, I'm supposed to do. I decided to procrastinate by writing this little program that allows you to control your Sony Android TV over the command line.  

This is an absolute "just for fun" and "because I can" project. You will be off much faster just using the normal Remote.

Well, I hope I find a way to directly jump to let's say a Netflix show then this might even become useful.
